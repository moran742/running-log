# Running-Log
 ...an easy, fast way to log runs from the command line

## Documentation
This script provides for command line input for date of run, minutes, miles, and comments.  All data is intended to be stored in CSV fashion.  Script is pretty raw right now, but hope to refactor and refine for general usage and provide a Ruby Gem.

#### To add a new log entry:
`log -new`

#### To display all log entries:
``log -display``

#### To display help menu:
``log -help``

#### To exit script:
``log -exit``


## The Future
* Add automatic geolocation and adding of weather info to each log entry
* Add search reporting tools to analyze log entries
* Better Documentation

## Supported Ruby Versions
Developed and tested on 1.9.2p125.  Should work on most versions.
